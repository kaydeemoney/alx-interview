Binomial Pascal Triangle Generator
This project is a Python implementation of the Pascal's Triangle, a triangular array of binomial coefficients used in algebra and probability. Each row of the triangle represents the coefficients of a binomial expansion. This implementation allows you to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.

Features
Generates Pascal's Triangle up to a user-defined number of rows.
Each row represents the coefficients of a binomial expansion.
Easy-to-understand Python code, suitable for learning or academic purposes.
